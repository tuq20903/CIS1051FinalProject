# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Musical Discord Bot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

For my project, I wanted to create a discord bot that would allow users to play music from youtube. It will also allow users to skip, pause, and shuffle through songs. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

For my project, I intend to develop a straightforward yet effective Discord bot utilizing Python. The primary aim of this software is to enhance communication and engagement within a Discord server by reacting to simple user commands. Even though this is my initial programming project, the bot will have multiple essential features: welcoming users upon joining the server, reacting to basic text commands (like “!hello”), and eventually playing brief audio snippets or songs when requested in a voice channel. The bot will execute a Python script that interfaces with Discord’s API via a distinctive bot token. After the bot is programmed and properly set up, it will be launched via the terminal on a Mac by executing a Python file. When operational, the bot will remain online and engage with users in real time, enabling me to experiment with features and enhance its capabilities gradually. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

What I want to accomplish no matter what is having the code written down, even if it doesn't work as it should. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can accomplish setting up the necessary files and folders needed to begin coding the bot.  

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to accomplish learning about different programs that could be used to establish my project. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

To successfully finish this project, I must acquire various new skills. Initially, I must grasp the fundamentals of Python programming, such as variables, functions, and how to organize a basic script. I will also need to investigate how APIs function, particularly Discord’s API, which enables bots to connect and engage with servers. An additional significant subject will be mastering the Discord.py library, which offers the resources needed to create bot commands, connect to voice channels, and stream audio. I also need to become familiar with Visual Studio Code, making files, utilizing the integrated terminal, and installing external libraries via pip. I will also need to understand how to resolve typical problems, such as installation mistakes, bot token issues, or connectivity problems.
