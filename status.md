#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far, I have used Developer Portal to create the bot, name it, and generate the link that is needed for someone to access the bot. Then I installed the necessary project dependencies like downloading the audio from youtube videoes and the program needed to parse and distinguish between the different links. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

What I'm still missing is the code needed to pause/resume the music, skip the music if someone wanted, and volume control. There are a few other commands that I am considering adding in but I will see if I'm able to. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I think my biggest issue was trying to work with discord.py with installing it and making sure everything was working as it should to be able to create the bot and get the link.
